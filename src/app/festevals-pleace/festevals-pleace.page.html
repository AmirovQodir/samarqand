   <h2>Registan Square</h2>
   <p>
     The ancient centre of Samarkand – “Registan” square with splendid madrasahs and minarets, where international music festival “Sharq Taronalari” (Melodies of the Orient) is held arouses the interest of the majority of people.
   </p>
   <p>
     Registan square is the symbol of Samarkand. Ulugbek, Sher-Dor madrasahs, Tilla – Kori mosque-madrasah in the Registan square are considered to be the unique models of architectural art of Samarkand.

   <p>
     Ulugbek Madrasah was constructed in 1417-1420 by order of Mirzo Ulugbek and it was one of the best clergy universities of that time. Two centuries later, Sher-Dor madrasah (1619-1636) and Tilla - Kori mosque - madrasah  (1646-1660) were built by order of the ruler of Samarkand Yalangtush Bakhodir. Above the entrance portal of Sher-Dor madrasah the scene of golden tigers haunting  baby deer was depicted. What did the architect of this building Master Abdujabborov want to say by this?
   </p>
   <p>
     Well-known scientist, academician Pulat Zokhidov shared with the following ideas about the decoration of Sher-Dor madrasah in his book “Me’mor olami” (“The world of Architecture”): Samarkand scientist Abu Tokhirkhuja in his book “Samariya”, written in 30th of XIX century, described the scene above the arch of madrasah connecting it with widespread sign of zodiacs in Muslim astrology. It shows the shape of the Sun united with the zodiac of Tiger. The Sun rays defend the deer from the attack of haunting Tiger. As if kindness defeat evil. This composition was created on the basis of astrology. According to the opinions of specialists, Yalangtush Bakhodir was represented as the symbol of male-tiger. The body of Tiger means Yalangtush Bakhodir’s   year of birth and the head of Tiger means his sign of zodiac. So it turned out to be that Yalangtush Bakhodir’s   year of birth was 1576 or 1578, and his date of birth was August,15. Two spots on the cheeks of a man described inside of the Sun have the following meaning: the human can be ideal when his soul and words are the same. We should say that the spot means ideality.

   <p>
     According to the opinion of some scientists, Yalangtush Bakhodir signed the symbols of holly Sun and Tiger, Deer and the ideality above the arch of madrasah, which represented the power of his government, the greatness and magnificence of Samarkand.
   </p>
   <p>
     Every scene above the arch of madrasah has its own meaning. The core meaning of this composition is following: intelligent person can reach spiritual pureness, and via spiritual pureness – ideality.
